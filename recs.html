    <h2>In Glasgow:</h2>
    <h3>Most <bold>museums</bold> across Scotland are free to the public. In Glasgow we recommend seeing original paintings by Dali, Picasso and Van Gogh in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YNXfajtaU32MnFxR9"><span>Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum</span></a> in Kelvingrove Park, as well as seeing priceless objects from across the ancient world in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/cgZXf9gLB83oKU6p9"><span>The Burrel Collection</span></a> on the grounds of Pollock Country Park.<br><br>We also recommend seeing the history of medicine exhibit in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LuaKbk3eo1grnJqE8"><span>The Hunterian Museum</span></a> in Glasgow University. It is the 4th oldest university in the UK (founded 1451), and is where Melanie and David met.
    <br><br>This city is known for its <bold>public parks</bold>, with the name Glasgow meaning "Dear Green Place" in old Gaelic. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/m6RhGwzSCc9j6ZBb9"><span>Kelvingrove Park</span></a>, the<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wqxmiyin32Ma6Wwf6"><span> Botanical Gardens</span></a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/swbXdU9YY4CPmuoZ8"><span>Glasgow Green</span></a> are all easily accessible for long walks, and you can head to the south side of the city for <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/p5KYgzKPWPnyXy689"><span>Pollock Country Park</span></a> if you want to see highland cows up close.<br><br>If you're looking for a spot of <bold>afternoon tea</bold>, we like the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/8GnxXB7tDEMjP6BB6"><span>The Willow Tea Rooms</span></a> in the city centre, with an interior designed by Glasgow architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh. You can also try <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Tjj83cvQh3imCRJg8"><span>Hidden Lane Tea Room</span></a> for another classic tea room, as well as <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/sUsPzDwNi6fF497D6"><span>Broken Clock Cafe</span></a> for the best cakes in Glasgow.
    <br><br>As for <bold>restaurants</bold>, we recommend trying Scottish cuisine at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Trs5mft9UTRLmUZz9"><span>The Ox and Finch</span></a> in Finnieston, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/oaR5wCMcSsjLHutX7"><span>The Ubiquitous Chip</span></a> on Ashton Lane and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PyqZw6shrzE1ka8F7"><span>Stravaigin</span></a> near Kelvingrove Park. For Italian food we recommend <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/iTJ2HKBShY8xDGSi7"><span>Santa Lucia Pasta</span></a> on Byre's Road and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Txt3PgdCidaJWSit8"><span>La Lanterna</span></a> on Argyle Street.
    <br><br>The late New York chef Anthony Bourdain famously <a href="https://youtu.be/4F2WKLhhnhk?si=hr_i9gzKoDu1wl_o"><span>declared Glasgow to be his favourite city in Europe</span></a>, particularly after trying fish and chips at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/y5gj3yVhKBvjSjGKA"><span>The University Cafe</span></a> on Byres Road, as well as an Indian curry from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ozfwJQez8YxhzJt48"><span>Mother India's Cafe</span></a> on Argyle Street.
    <br><br>For <bold>evening entertainment</bold>, we recommend checking out the Byre's Road area of Glasgow's West End, where you will find many local pubs and restaurants. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/41TUqQV7pvR1WxDC7"><span>The Hillhead Bookclub</span></a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/D61AnwqwhjB3ypzB6"><span>Rascal</span></a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/AFpeTWpsSh9VC1eH8"><span>The Sparkle Horse</span></a> are worth visiting for a drink, while in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mp6PeVqXr22PWExG9"><span>Oran Mor</span></a> you can get a “A Play, A Pie and A Pint”, with a new play at lunchtime every week lasting no more than an hour, accompanied by a pie and a pint of beer.

    <h2>In Loch Lomond:</h2>
    <h3>
    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wwNzwXgGZVwML9eZ7"><span>Balloch Country Park</span></a> is 200 acres of walled botanical gardens and forest nature trails on the banks of Loch Lomond. Get the train to nearby Balloch Station directly from Glasgow, and visit the town for some fish and chips or a coffee.
      <br><br><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/iL2rEg8dWsvRfsDk9"><span>Luss</span></a> is a small village on the banks of Loch Lomond, known for its picturesque cottages and peaceful beach and pier. Spend time in the local tourist shop and try the soup in the local cafe. You can also see the <a href="https://blosslynspage.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/the-viking-hogback-stone-of-luss-loch-lomond-scotland/"><span>Viking grave</span></a> from the 13th century Viking raids on western Scotland.
      <br><br><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LtXgbWbfCgfn8BmA8"><span>Cameron House</span></a> is a luxury resort also on the banks of Loch Lomond, on the opposite site of the loch from Boturich. Visit here for the outdoor thermal spa, restaurants, whiskey bar and sport activities. 
      <br><br><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3nBaYuDg34PzeFKb7"><span>Conic Hill</span></a> is a low difficulty hike near the town of Balmaha, which takes about 1 hour to reach the summit which gives truly fantastic and unique views over the entire Loch Lomond Area and marks the beginning of the Highland Boundary Fault.</h3>
    <h2>In Edinburgh:</h2>
    <h3>
    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dXdKocEkRrv21h7FA"><span>Edinburgh Castle</span></a> is a must-see for all visitors to Scotland, one of the oldest permanently occupied sites in the UK. Visit to see the the crown jewels and artifacts of Scotland's ancient monarchy, including the sacred <a href="https://www.edinburghcastle.scot/see-and-do/highlights/the-stone-of-destiny"><span>Stone of Destiny</span></a>.
    <br><br><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SszEtADKcoGqdhHt8"><span>The National Museum of Scotland</span></a> is the museum we would recommend to visit in Edinburgh, containing cultural and archeological artifacts from Scotland and across the world, as well as exhibits about Scotland's natural history.
    <br><br><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ciTUa7ZDkBZuWcjd8"><span>Greyfriars Bobby’s Bar</span></a> is a classic British pub and a place highly recommended by us. Check out the statue of the owner's loyal dog Bobby sitting patiently outside.
    <br><br><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/i2aWtC1xjwUcUTf89"><span>Gurkha Cafe</span></a> is another favourite curry spot for Melanie and David, serving Nepalese food. Try their homemade mango lassi drink!
    <br><br><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/abByFEtqjHp25pzp9"><span>Mary's Milk Bar</span></a> is widely considered one of the best ice cream shops in Scotland (and has good milkshakes too). Let's all hope the weather in summer 2024 justifies a visit to this Edinbugh instiution.</h3>
